# Watch Code Review - Zero-Token Background Polling

Monitors a pull request for Copilot code review completion using a background shell script. The agent consumes **zero LLM tokens** while the script polls, resuming only when the review lands.

## When to Use This Skill

- User just pushed a PR to a `github` org repo and wants to address Copilot review comments
- User wants to be notified when Copilot finishes reviewing their PR
- User says "watch for Copilot review", "let me know when the review is done", etc.
- After creating a PR, proactively offer to watch for Copilot review if the repo is in the `github` org

## Core Mechanism

The key technique: launch a shell script via `bash` in `async` mode, then use `read_bash` with a long delay to check back. The LLM is **not invoked** during the delay — only the shell script runs.

```
Agent turn 1:  bash(mode="async") → launches polling script → returns shellId
Agent turn 2:  read_bash(shellId, delay=120) → script still running → empty output
Agent turn 3:  read_bash(shellId, delay=120) → "REVIEW_COMPLETE" → agent resumes
```

## Implementation

### Step 1: Identify the PR

Determine which PR to watch:

```bash
# Current branch's PR
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)

# Or explicit PR number from user
PR_NUMBER=123
```

### Step 2: Launch the Polling Script

Run this script using `bash` with `mode="async"`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Poll for Copilot code review on a PR
# Usage: watch-code-review.sh <owner/repo> <pr_number> [interval_seconds] [timeout_seconds]

REPO="${1}"
PR_NUMBER="${2}"
INTERVAL="${3:-30}"
TIMEOUT="${4:-3600}"

ELAPSED=0

while [ "$ELAPSED" -lt "$TIMEOUT" ]; do
    # Query for reviews from known Copilot reviewer login variants
    REVIEW_STATE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" \
        --repo "$REPO" \
        --json reviews \
        --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login | test("^(copilot|copilot-pull-request-reviewer(\\[bot\\])?|github-copilot\\[bot\\])$"))] | last | .state // empty')

    if [ -n "$REVIEW_STATE" ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "✅ REVIEW_COMPLETE"
        echo "Review state: ${REVIEW_STATE}"
        echo "PR: #${PR_NUMBER}"
        echo "Repo: ${REPO}"

        # Also grab the review comments for the agent
        echo ""
        echo "--- REVIEW BODY ---"
        gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" \
            --repo "$REPO" \
            --json reviews \
            --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login | test("^(copilot|copilot-pull-request-reviewer(\\[bot\\])?|github-copilot\\[bot\\])$"))] | last | .body // "No body"'
        echo "--- END REVIEW BODY ---"
        exit 0
    fi

    sleep "$INTERVAL"
    ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + INTERVAL))

    # Silent polling - no output to avoid waking the agent
done

echo ""
echo "⏰ TIMEOUT"
echo "Copilot review not detected after ${TIMEOUT}s for PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
exit 1
```

**Critical implementation details:**

1. Use `bash` with `mode="async"` to launch the script — this gives you a `shellId`
2. The script produces NO output while polling (output would appear in `read_bash`)
3. Only when the review is found (or timeout) does it print, which `read_bash` will pick up

### Step 3: Wait with read_bash

After launching the script, use `read_bash` with a long delay. This is where the zero-token magic happens — the LLM is not invoked during the delay.

```
read_bash(shellId=<id>, delay=120)
```

**Choosing the delay:**
- Start with `delay=120` (2 minutes) — Copilot reviews typically take 1–5 minutes
- If no output, call `read_bash` again with `delay=120`
- The script handles its own polling interval (30s default); the `read_bash` delay is how often the agent checks if the script has output

### Step 4: Process the Result

When `read_bash` returns output containing `REVIEW_COMPLETE`:

1. Parse the review state and comments from the script output
2. Fetch the detailed review threads:
   ```bash
   gh pr view PR_NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --json reviews,reviewThreads
   ```
3. Present a summary to the user:
   ```
   ✅ Copilot finished reviewing PR #123!

   Review state: CHANGES_REQUESTED

   Comments:
   1. src/auth.ts:42 - Consider using constant-time comparison for token validation
   2. src/api.ts:15 - Missing error handling for network timeout

   Would you like me to address these comments?
   ```
4. **Ask the user** before making any changes — do not auto-fix

When `read_bash` returns output containing `TIMEOUT`:
- Notify the user that the review hasn't arrived
- Offer to keep watching or stop

### Step 5: Address Review Comments (if requested)

If the user asks to fix the comments:

1. Fetch the full review threads with file paths and line numbers:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
     --jq '.[] | select(.user.login | test("^(copilot|copilot-pull-request-reviewer(\\[bot\\])?|github-copilot\\[bot\\])$")) | {path, line, body, diff_hunk}'
   ```
2. Read each referenced file
3. Make the suggested fixes
4. Present the changes for user approval before committing

## Complete Agent Flow

Here's the full flow the agent should follow:

```
1. User: "watch for Copilot review on my PR"

2. Agent (turn 1):
   - Detect PR number (gh pr view or user-provided)
   - Detect repo (gh repo view or parse from remote)
   - Launch polling script via bash(mode="async")
   - Tell user: "Watching PR #X for Copilot review. I'll check back shortly."

3. Agent (turn 2+):
   - read_bash(shellId, delay=120)
   - If empty → call read_bash again (script still polling)
   - If "REVIEW_COMPLETE" → proceed to step 4
   - If "TIMEOUT" → notify user, offer to retry

4. Agent (on review detected):
   - Fetch detailed review comments via gh CLI
   - Present summary to user
   - Ask: "Would you like me to address these comments?"

5. Agent (if user says yes):
   - Read referenced files
   - Apply fixes
   - Show diff for approval
   - Commit and push when approved
```

## Error Handling

### PR Not Found
```bash
if ! gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ PR #$PR_NUMBER not found in $REPO"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Not Authenticated
```bash
if ! gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Not authenticated with GitHub CLI"
    echo "Run: gh auth login"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Script Already Running
Before launching a new watcher, check if one is already active for this PR:
```bash
# The agent should track the shellId and avoid launching duplicates
```

## Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Polling interval | 30s | How often the shell script checks for the review |
| Timeout | 3600s (1hr) | Maximum time to wait before giving up |
| read_bash delay | 120s | How often the agent checks the script output |

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Monitor for Copilot code review completion on GitHub PRs
- Run as a background shell script (zero tokens while polling)
- Present review comments to the user
- Address review comments when the user asks

**Will Not:**
- Auto-fix review comments without user confirmation
- Monitor non-Copilot reviews (use for human reviewer watching is out of scope)
- Work outside the `gh` CLI ecosystem
- Poll indefinitely (respects timeout)

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | When to Combine |
|-------|-----------------|
| watch-ci | Watch both CI and code review simultaneously after pushing a PR |
| notify-me | Send a Slack DM when the review lands (if notify-me skill is available) |

## Quick Reference

**Key commands used:**
```bash
# Check for Copilot review
gh pr view PR --repo OWNER/REPO --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login | test("^(copilot|copilot-pull-request-reviewer(\\[bot\\])?|github-copilot\\[bot\\])$"))] | last | .state'

# Get review comments with file locations
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login | test("^(copilot|copilot-pull-request-reviewer(\\[bot\\])?|github-copilot\\[bot\\])$")) | {path, line, body}'

# Get current PR number
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'

# Get repo in OWNER/REPO format
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'
```
