# Dot Files

My installation command for Mac and Codespaces. This keeps config files in locations where Codespaces can read it, without using an installation script. 

## Notes

* For Mac, also run Ruby steps from <https://mac.install.guide/rubyonrails/1>
* The ZSH files are largely taken from <https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-launchpad>
